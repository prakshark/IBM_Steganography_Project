# IBM Steganography Project

This project was created as part of my 2 month long Cyber Security Internship at IBM, affiliated by AICTE. Steganography is a concept, highly used in Cyber Security, as well as Cyber Crimes. This technique involves embedding a secret message into a pre-existing image, which seems normal to human eyes. Only the ones who have access to this program, is able to decode the image to get the embedded message.
